export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Enable Docker BuildKit for consistent and enhanced build behavior
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # 1. Overrides Local Defaults
    #    Not all systems have Docker BuildKit enabled by default. By explicitly
    #    exporting DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1, we ensure that Docker uses the BuildKit engine
    #    regardless of the user's local Docker configuration or version. This avoids
    #    discrepancies between environments where BuildKit may or may not be active.

    # 2. Standardizes Build Features
    #    BuildKit supports advanced Dockerfile syntax such as:
    #      - RUN --mount=type=secret
    #      - COPY --chmod
    #    These features are not supported by the legacy builder. Without BuildKit,
    #    such instructions may fail silently or be ignored, leading to unpredictable
    #    or broken builds. Enabling BuildKit ensures these features work as intended.

    # 3. Aligns CI/CD and Local Builds
    #    In continuous integration environments like Jenkins, BuildKit may already be
    #    preconfigured. By enabling it explicitly in this script, we guarantee that
    #    local development builds behave the same way as those in CI/CD pipelines.
    #    This alignment reduces "works on my machine" issues and improves reliability.

    # 4. Improves Caching and Performance
    #    BuildKit introduces a smarter caching mechanism that speeds up builds and
    #    reduces redundant steps. It enables parallel execution and better reuse of
    #    intermediate layers, resulting in faster and more reproducible builds across
    #    different machines and environments.

    # 5. Supports Secure Features
    #    BuildKit allows secure handling of sensitive data during builds, including:
    #      - Secrets management via --mount=type=secret
    #      - SSH forwarding for accessing private repositories
    #    These capabilities are unavailable in the legacy builder. Enabling BuildKit
    #    ensures that secure workflows and advanced build scenarios are supported
    #    consistently and safely.
