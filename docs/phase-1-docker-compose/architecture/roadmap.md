## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the observability lab from its current Docker Compose foundation through Kubernetes refactoring to hybrid cloud deployment. The journey represents a structured learning path that mirrors real-world infrastructure modernization patterns.

### Vision Statement

The "On-Prem Domain" project aims to build comprehensive infrastructure expertise by:

1. **Understanding fundamentals** through hands-on on-premises infrastructure
2. **Mastering orchestration** via progressive tooling adoption
3. **Migrating strategically** to cloud with full architectural awareness
4. **Operating hybrid environments** combining on-prem and cloud strengths

**Core Philosophy:** Learn what cloud abstractions hide by building without them first, then appreciate managed services by understanding what they solve.

- SAST/DAST gates (maintain security posture in K8s)

**Can Proceed Without Phase 2:**
- Phase 3 can start without Phase 2 complete
- Security tooling can be added to Kubernetes later
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 can run in parallel

### Phase 3 → Phase 4 Dependencies

**Required from Phase 3:**
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- ✅ Ansible playbooks for automation

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Istio service mesh (easier to migrate to AWS App Mesh or stay with Istio on EKS)
- ArgoCD GitOps (can use same approach on EKS)

**Blockers if Phase 3 Incomplete:**
- No Kubernetes manifests to lift to EKS
- No automation patterns to apply in cloud

## Risk Management

### Common Risks Across All Phases

#### Risk: Scope Creep

**Description:** Adding too many features or technologies beyond planned scope
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium (delays, incomplete features)

**Mitigation:**
- Define clear success criteria per phase
- Resist temptation to add "just one more tool"
- Timebox exploration of new technologies
- Document "future enhancements" section instead of implementing immediately

#### Risk: Learning Curve Underestimation

**Description:** New technologies taking longer to learn than expected
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium (timeline delays)

**Mitigation:**
- Allocate buffer time (20-30%) in timeline estimates
- Start with proof-of-concept before full implementation
- Use official documentation and tutorials
- Engage with community forums and Slack channels

#### Risk: Hardware/Resource Constraints

**Description:** Insufficient compute, storage, or network for advanced phases
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (blockers)

**Mitigation:**
- Plan resource requirements upfront for each phase
- Evaluate cloud alternatives if on-prem resources insufficient
- Optimize existing workloads before scaling
- Consider phased hardware upgrades

#### Risk: Documentation Lag

**Description:** Implementation outpacing documentation updates
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium (knowledge loss)

**Mitigation:**
- Document as you build (not after)
- Create templates for architecture, design decisions, and runbooks
- Use code comments and README files liberally
- Schedule dedicated documentation sprints

### Phase-Specific Risks

#### Phase 2 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Vault integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Reuse prior implementation, start simple |
| Policy authoring errors | High | Low | Test policies in non-prod first |
| Security scan false positives | High | Low | Tune scan rules, establish exemption process |

#### Phase 3 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data loss during PostgreSQL migration | Low | Critical | Multiple backups, validation scripts, test in dev |
| Kubernetes complexity overwhelm | High | Medium | Incremental adoption, one concept at a time |
| Service mesh performance overhead | Medium | Medium | Monitor latency, disable if unacceptable |
| Multi-node networking issues | Medium | High | Test in isolated environment, document troubleshooting |

#### Phase 4 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| AWS cost overruns | High | High | Budget alerts, daily cost dashboards, right-sizing |
| Vendor lock-in | Medium | Medium | Use open standards (OTel, K8s), document migration paths |
| Performance degradation in cloud | Medium | Medium | Extensive load testing, monitoring, rollback plan |
| Hybrid connectivity failures | Medium | High | Redundant VPN tunnels, test failover scenarios |

## Proof of Concept Foundation

### Why This Matters

This roadmap builds upon a **production-grade proof of concept**, not a toy project. The foundation established in Phase 1 demonstrates:

**Production Patterns:**
- Reverse proxy architecture (Nginx)
- Full observability (three pillars: traces, metrics, logs)
- SLI/SLO tracking (availability, latency, error rates)
- Automated deployment via CI/CD
- Healthchecks and graceful degradation

**Battle-Tested:**
- Every error encountered, debugged, and documented
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guides
- Source code audits for accuracy
- Real-world debugging experience

**Learning-Oriented:**
- Documentation exceeds 152,000 words
- Design decisions captured with rationale
- Journey narrative includes failures and breakthroughs
- Transferable skills to enterprise and cloud environments

### Maintaining the Proof of Concept Nature

As the project evolves through Phases 2-4, maintain these principles:

**1. Learn First, Optimize Later**
- Prioritize understanding over perfection
- Document trade-offs and alternatives
- Accept "good enough" for learning purposes

**2. Production-Inspired, Not Production-Required**
- Use production-grade tools and patterns
- But don't over-engineer for scale you don't need
- Focus on learning the architecture, not running at Google scale

**3. Iterative and Experimental**
- Phases can overlap or run in parallel
- Feel free to skip ahead if a technology excites you
- Return to earlier phases to refine

**4. Documentation is Part of the Product**
- Every phase must include comprehensive documentation
- Capture design decisions, not just implementation
- Write for future you (you will forget)

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines a multi-year journey from on-premises Docker Compose to hybrid cloud Kubernetes. Each phase builds upon the last, introducing new technologies and patterns while maintaining the core philosophy:

**Learn what cloud abstractions hide by building without them first.**

The phases are structured but flexible. Adjust timelines, skip ahead, or iterate based on your learning goals and available time. The key is to maintain momentum, document as you go, and embrace failures as learning opportunities.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Complete (October 2025)
- 🚧 Phase 2: Planning (Q1 2026)
- 📋 Phase 3: Planning (Q2-Q3 2026)
- 📋 Phase 4: Planning (Q4 2026+)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review Phase 2 deliverables
2. Allocate time for OPA/Rego learning
3. Provision resources for SonarQube and Artifactory
4. Begin policy library creation
